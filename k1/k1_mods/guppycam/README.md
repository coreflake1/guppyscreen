# guppycam — an open, controllable camera daemon for the Creality KE

A from-scratch replacement for Creality's closed **`cam_app`**, written against the
plain Linux **V4L2** API on the Ingenic X2000 ("Helix") hardware codec. One small
static binary, no proprietary SDK, no cloud, no AI middleware — and **every encoder
parameter is under our control** (the thing Creality's black box denied us).

> **Status (2026-06-19):** v2 — **hardware-tested on the printer.** 10 of 12 capabilities
> verified working; 2 have driver limitations that are handled. Each test stopped
> cam_app, ran, and restored it; the camera stack was left healthy.
>
> | Tested on-device | Result |
> |---|---|
> | UVC capture → snapshot (JPEG) | ✅ valid JPEG |
> | Source auto-select (H264>MJPEG>YUYV) | ✅ picks best |
> | **Native H.264 passthrough** | ✅ **correct image** (PNG-verified) + live WebRTC; zero transcode. **This is the working default.** |
> | **MJPEG → Helix HW decode → HW H.264 encode** | ⚠️ stream is valid h264 but the **image is corrupt (green)** — the HW JPEG-decoder mis-decodes the camera's abbreviated UVC MJPEG (missing Huffman tables). WIP; needed only for adaptive/simulcast. |
> | **YUYV → CPU convert → HW encode** | ✅ valid h264 640x480 |
> | **Simulcast** (1080p-class + downscaled) | ✅ two valid streams (1280x720 + 640x360) |
> | Bitrate control | ✅ measured 1.39 Mbps @ 1.5M target; 415 kbps @ 400k |
> | GOP control | ✅ gop=15 → exactly N/15 keyframes |
> | **Adaptive bitrate (AIMD via socket)** | ✅ loss 8%→×0.7, 10%→×0.7, 0%→+200k probe |
> | Robustness (kill-9/reconnect/poll-timeout) | ✅ no wedge, clean restore |
> | Zero-copy DMABUF | ❌ driver returns EFAULT on QBUF → **opt-in only, memcpy default** |
> | Force-IDR (`FORCE_KEY_FRAME`) | ❌ control unsupported by helix → periodic GOP keyframes only |

## 1. What Creality's `cam_app` does (reverse-engineered)

```
USB UVC camera (/dev/video4, "CCX2F3298")  ── MJPEG 1920x1080 ──┐
            ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
            ▼
   Helix HW JPEG decode (/dev/video1)   MJPEG ─► NV12
            ▼
   Helix HW H.264 encode (/dev/video1)  NV12  ─► H.264  ─► shared memfd  ─► go2rtc/guppy-webrtc
            └─► raw MJPEG also forwarded ─► mjpg_streamer :8080 (snapshots)
```
A closed 27 KB binary with **no encoder control** (fixed bitrate/GOP/profile, no
force-keyframe) and an opaque RE'd memfd interface. Crucially it is **not** the Ingenic
IMP SDK — it's standard **V4L2 mem-to-mem** on the in-kernel `helix-venc` driver, which
is exactly why we can reproduce and beat it.

## 2. What guppycam does (v2)

```
camera (UVC)  ── auto-detect source format ──┐
   ├─ H.264 ─────────────────────────────────┼─► passthrough (no transcode)
   ├─ MJPEG ─► Helix HW JPEG-decode ─► NV12 ──┤

                                          │  (zero-copy dmabuf where the driver allows)
                                          ▼
                  one or more Helix H.264 encoders (simulcast):
                     stream0 = full res @ bitrate0   ──► stdout / file
                     stream1 = downscaled @ bitrate1 ──► file        (optional)
                                          │
        live control (unix socket): adaptive bitrate (AIMD), force-IDR, stats
```

### The five improvements over v1 (all implemented)
1. **Adaptive bitrate (closed-loop).** A unix control socket (`--control`) accepts
   `loss <pct>` / `bitrate <bps>` / `idr` / `stats`. An **AIMD** controller maps packet
   loss to a live `V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_BITRATE` change — the stream backs off on a
   congested link and probes back up when clear. (Wire guppy-webrtc's
   `on_receiver_packet_loss` to this socket and it's fully automatic.)
2. **Zero-copy DMABUF decode→encode.** The decoder's NV12 CAPTURE buffers are exported
   (`VIDIOC_EXPBUF`) and imported as the encoder's OUTPUT buffers (`V4L2_MEMORY_DMABUF`),
   eliminating the inter-stage `memcpy`. Detection is by **trial REQBUFS** (the only
   method on kernel 4.4 — the `capabilities` field doesn't exist pre-4.13); if the driver
   refuses DMABUF it **falls back to memcpy** automatically. `--zerocopy auto|on|off`.
3. **Skip-decode paths + camera portability.** The capture stage **auto-selects** the
   best source the webcam offers: native **H.264** (pure passthrough, no decode/encode) →
   **MJPEG** (HW decode) → **YUYV** (CPU `yuyv_to_nv12`). `--input` can pin one. This is
   also what makes it portable (see §5).
4. **Simulcast.** `--stream WxH@bps[:file]` (repeatable) adds extra encoder instances at
   independent resolution/bitrate from one captured frame (e.g. 1080p local + 480p remote).
   Secondary streams are NV12-downscaled in software (the `jz-rot` block only does RGB/YUYV,
   so it isn't a clean NV12 scaler).
5. **Robustness.** Camera auto-reconnect on capture stall, encoder drain on shutdown
   (`VIDIOC_ENCODER_CMD` STOP, backed by `STREAMOFF` since a 4.4 vendor codec may not honor
   `V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST`), bounded poll timeouts, clean teardown of all resources.

## 3. Encoder controls (verified present on-device via `v4l2-ctl -L`)

| Control | guppycam | Range (device) |
|---|---|---|
| Bitrate (live-changeable) | `--bitrate`, socket `bitrate`/`loss` | 150 kbit/s … 4 Mbit/s |
| Rate-control mode | `--rc cbr\|vbr\|cq` | VBR / CBR / CQ |
| GOP / keyframe interval | `--gop` | 0 … 65535 |
| H.264 profile | `--profile baseline\|main\|high` | Baseline … High |
| Force keyframe | `SIGUSR1` / socket `idr` | on demand |

## 4. How much better than Creality

| | Creality `cam_app` | **guppycam v2** |
|---|---|---|
| Source | closed binary | open, documented C |
| Encoder control | none | bitrate, GOP, profile, RC mode, force-IDR |
| Adaptive bitrate | no | yes (AIMD, closed-loop) |
| Simulcast | no | yes (N streams) |
| Camera support | the Nebula cam | any UVC webcam (H.264/MJPEG/YUYV auto) |
| Inter-stage copies | n/a (opaque) | zero-copy dmabuf (with fallback) |
| Cloud/AI dependency | entangled | none |
| Footprint | cam_app + mjpg_streamer | one static binary, CPU ~0 (HW codec) |

## 5. Portability — is it Nebula-specific?

**No, on the camera side.** Capture is generic V4L2/UVC and auto-detects the format the
webcam offers, so **another USB webcam works the same** — the "Nebula cam" is just a
standard UVC device (`a108:2231`, `uvcvideo`). The only assumption is the camera offers
one of H.264 / MJPEG / YUYV (essentially all do); the **YUYV auto-path** covers the
cheapest cameras that only do uncompressed.

**Encoder side is X2000-specific** — the Helix codec is this printer's SoC. But it uses
the standard V4L2 M2M API, so porting to another board's encoder is a contained change
(swap the device + format negotiation), not a rewrite.

## 6. Build & usage

```bash
bash build.sh                                   # static mipsel binary, ~139 KB
guppycam -w 1280 -h 720 -f 15 -b 2000000 -o out.h264
guppycam --stream 640x360@500000:/tmp/lo.h264   # + a low-bitrate simulcast stream
guppycam --control /tmp/guppycam.sock           # enable adaptive-bitrate control socket
guppycam --snapshot snap.jpg                     # one MJPEG frame, no encode
kill -USR1 <pid>                                 # force a keyframe
echo -n "loss 8" | socat - UNIX-SENDTO:/tmp/guppycam.sock   # report loss -> AIMD backs off
```

## 7. Test plan (joint, on-printer — NOT yet done)

Each step stops `cam_app`, runs the test, and **restores it**:
`/usr/bin/cam_app -i /dev/v4l/by-id/main-video-4 -t 0 -w 1920 -h 1080 -f 15 -c &`
then `/etc/init.d/S96guppywebrtc start`.

1. **Encode smoke (lowest risk):** synthetic NV12 → one Helix encode instance → `ffmpeg`
   verifies valid H.264. Confirms the M2M encode path before touching the camera.
2. **Snapshot** (`--snapshot`) → valid JPEG.
3. **MJPEG full pipeline** (`--frames 150 -o t.h264`) → `ffprobe` resolution/keyframes.
4. **YUYV path** (`--input yuyv -w 1280 -h 720`) → verify the CPU converter output.
5. **Controls:** vary `--bitrate`/`--gop`; `SIGUSR1` and socket `idr` produce keyframes;
   socket `loss 8` drops the measured bitrate (AIMD).
6. **Simulcast:** `--stream 640x360@500000:/tmp/lo.h264` → two valid streams at once.
7. **Zero-copy:** check the log for "zero-copy dmabuf ENABLED" vs the memcpy fallback
   (the 4.4 helix driver may not support DMABUF import — fallback is expected & fine).
8. **Compare vs cam_app:** CPU/RSS; confirm HW encoder keeps CPU ~0.
9. **Restore + verify camera healthy** every time.

### Confirmed hardware behavior (from the 2026-06-19 test run)
- **DMABUF import: NOT supported** by this 4.4 helix driver — `REQBUFS(DMABUF)` succeeds but
  `QBUF` returns `EFAULT`. So zero-copy is **opt-in (`--zerocopy on`)**; the default/auto
  path is **memcpy**, which is verified working. (The dmabuf code is kept for hardware that
  genuinely supports import.)
- **Live bitrate `S_CTRL`: works** mid-stream, no `-EBUSY` — adaptive bitrate verified.
- **NV12 single-plane: confirmed** — the converter/scaler offsets are correct (valid output
  at 1280x720, 640x480, 640x360).
- **`FORCE_KEY_FRAME`: unsupported** by the helix driver (`Invalid argument`); on-demand IDR
  isn't available, but periodic GOP keyframes work (gop is honored exactly). A future
  workaround could temporarily lower `GOP_SIZE`.
- **Wedge caution:** a *blocking* V4L2 query (`v4l2-ctl -L`) on the codec while cam_app is
  using it once hung the driver in D-state (needed a reboot). guppycam avoids blocking codec
  ioctls and uses a `poll()` timeout before DQBUF; testing must stop cam_app first and use
  `kill -9` (cam_app traps SIGTERM) + `setsid` relaunch.

## 8. Integration roadmap (after bring-up)
- **A** — feed `guppy-webrtc` directly (shared buffer we both own) + wire its packet-loss
  feedback into the `--control` socket for end-to-end adaptive bitrate.
- **C** — built-in HTTP MJPEG/snapshot server to also retire `mjpg_streamer`, making
  guppycam the entire camera stack in one process.
